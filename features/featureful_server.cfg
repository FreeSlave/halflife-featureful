// Half-Life makes monsters with non-empty targetname to wait 5 seconds after spawn before AI gets to normal.

// This behavior however most notably affects named monsters coming from monstermakers, so we add a feature to control whether such monsters are affected.
monsters_spawned_named_wait_trigger true
